Pig Game


    A classic dice game for two players.
    Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
    Roll the dice to add points to your current score.
    If you roll a 1, you lose your current score and your turn ends.
    Hold to save your current score and switch turns.
    The first player to reach 100 points or more wins the game!
